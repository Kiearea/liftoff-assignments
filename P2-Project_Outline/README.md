## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a live map (Google Map) that allows users to place pins on the map for restaurants they've visited that have allergy-friendly foods. (there may be an attached drop-down on each pin to quickly see which allergens the restaurant caters to).The app will allow users to find/add restaurants that caters to those of us with food allergies. There are 2 types of users: 

* Those with allergies
* Family/friends of those with allergies

Users will also be able to search all pinned restaurants for allergens they hope to avoid.

If they sign-up/sign-in, they can keep track of the places they've visited and places they want to visit.
### Features
* Anyone can see/use the map of pre-pinned restaurants
* Only those who've signed up can add new pins
* Users can add pins to the map
* Users can save their favorite places/places they want to visit
### Technologies
* Java
* Thymeleaf
* Springboot
* HTML5/CSS3
* Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
* Some JavaScript (for the map to work properly)
* Java (solidify concepts that we went over a bit too quickly for my liking)
* How to be totally awesome (who am I kidding? I already am! :))
